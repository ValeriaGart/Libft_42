# LIBFT

## My very first C project ðŸ«¶

This is a library of functions that reproduce the behaviour of some common functions + ones for managing simple structs/lists.

## But why?..

Well, that was one of the mandatory projects. Now after finishing it i realize how convenient it is using functions you codded yourself from the scratch. Knowing how the things exactly work and have an oportunity to not think of it, is a great privilage. Especially when it's about dinamic memory allocation, when you have to know how each byte is stored ðŸ˜µ

# USAGE

`make` to compile 

`make bonus` to compile with bonus part (operations with lists)

`make clean` to remove all the object files

`make fclean` to delete object files + .a
