# LIBFT

## My very first C project 🫶

This is a library of functions that reproduce the behaviour of some common functions + ones for managing simple structs/lists.

## But why?..

Well, that was one of the mandatory projects and now after finishing it i realize how convenient it is using functions you codded yourself from the scratch. Knowing how exactly things work and have oportunity to not think of it is agreat privilage. Especially when it's about dinamic memory allocation, when you have to know how each byte is stored 😵

# USAGE

`make` to compile 
`make bonus` to compile with bonus part (operations with lists)

`make clean` to remove all the object files
`make fclean` to delete object files + .a
